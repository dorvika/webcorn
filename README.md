# Webcorn
- Landing Page about Google Ads.
- Developed with Create React App.
- Here I have used functional components and hooks.  
- The application's architecture consists of components and containers.
- Form was developed using Formik.
- Input's validation was implemented with the help of Yup.
- All the data used on the page is collected in object arrays, so the code is easy to maintain and change in the future.  
- The application can easily be connected to the Telegram bot, so the customer will immediately receive the potential client's contacts.
- Fully responsive.
